# Satisfactory Calculator

## Description

This calculator is meant to help all Satisfactorians helping plan their awesome factories. A [Sankey diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankey_diagram) helps to visualize the amount of material flow. Unwanted products can be hidden intuitively to focus on relevant ones.
